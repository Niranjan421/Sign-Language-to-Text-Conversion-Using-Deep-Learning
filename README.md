**ABSTRACT:** 

 Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication, hence we have come up with a real time method using neural networks for finger spelling based American sign language. Automatic human gesture recognition from camera images is an interesting topic for developing vision. We propose a convolution neural network (CNN) method to recognize hand gestures of human actions from an image captured by camera. The purpose is to recognize hand gestures of human task activities from a camera image. The position of hand and orientation are applied to obtain the training and testing data for the CNN. The hand is first passed through a filter and after the filter is applied where the hand is passed through a classifier which predicts the class of the hand gestures. Then the calibrated images are used to train CNN. 
 

 
**Introduction:**

 American sign language is a predominant sign language Since the only disability D&M people have been communication related and they cannot use spoken languages hence the only way for them to communicate is through sign language. Communication is the process of exchange of thoughts and messages in various ways such as speech, signals, behavior and visuals. Deaf and dumb(D&M) people make use of their hands to express different gestures to express their ideas with other people. Gestures are the nonverbally exchanged messages and these gestures are understood with vision. This nonverbal communication of deaf and dumb people is called sign language. 

In our project we basically focus on producing a model which can recognise Fingerspelling based hand gestures in order to form a complete word by combining each gesture. The gestures we aim to train are as given in the image below.

**Requirements:**

More than 70 million deaf people around the world use sign languages to communicate. Sign language allows them to learn, work, access services, and be included in the communities.  

It is hard to make everybody learn the use of sign language with the goal of ensuring that people with disabilities can enjoy their rights on an equal basis with others. 

So, the aim is to develop a user-friendly human computer interface (HCI) where the computer understands the American sign language This Project will help the dumb and deaf people by making their life easy. 


**Objective:**
To create a computer software and train a model using CNN which takes an image of hand gesture of American Sign Language and shows the output of the particular sign language in text format converts it into audio format. 


**Scope:**
This System will be Beneficial for Both Dumb/Deaf People and the People Who do not understands the Sign Language. They just need to do that with sign Language gestures and this system will identify what he/she is trying to say after identification it gives the output in the form of Text as well as Speech format. 

**Modules:**

**Data Acquisition :**

The different approaches to acquire data about the hand gesture can be done in the following ways: 

It uses electromechanical devices to provide exact hand configuration, and position. Different glove-based approaches can be used to extract information. But it is expensive and not user friendly. 

In vision-based methods, the computer webcam is the input device for observing the information of hands and/or fingers. The Vision Based methods require only a camera, thus realizing a natural interaction between humans and computers without the use of any extra devices, thereby reducing costs.  The main challenge of vision-based hand detection ranges from coping with the large variability of the human handâ€™s appearance due to a huge number of hand movements, to different skin-color possibilities as well as to the variations in viewpoints, scales, and speed of the camera capturing the scene. 

 ## NOTE:
The trained model and dataset has not been uploaded due to GitHub's file size restriction, which limits uploads to files smaller than 25MB.
